Portfolio Reflection - CS 250

Understanding and Implementing User Needs
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is a cornerstone of successful software development. Throughout my coursework and particularly in the SNHU Travel project, I've learned that user needs are best understood through direct interaction and feedback loops. Creating "user stories" is instrumental in this process, as they serve as a nexus between actual user requirements and the technical features we develop. User stories break down complex demands into actionable and testable units, ensuring that the development work is aligned with what users truly want and need.

My Approach to Developing Programs
Developing programs is as much about mindset as it is about technical prowess. My approach has been deeply influenced by agile processes, embracing iterative development, continuous integration, and adaptive planning. These practices help me stay flexible and responsive to change, which is especially important in a fast-paced industry. Looking ahead, I aim to further embed practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming into my workflow. These techniques not only improve code quality but also foster knowledge sharing and continuous learning.

Being a Good Team Member
Being a good team member in software development transcends technical skills. It's about being collaborative, communicative, and committed. It's also about being open to giving and receiving feedback, as well as having the willingness to adapt and improve continuously. During the SNHU Travel project, I learned that transparency and reliability are the glue that holds a team together. As we navigated through sprints, my ability to contribute effectively hinged on my willingness to support my teammates, meet my commitments, and stay engaged with our collective goals.
